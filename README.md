# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Unity with a focus on clean UI, responsive gameplay, and bug-free functionality. This project follows a tutorial to understand the process of developing a game from scratch, integrating both the UI and gameplay logic. 

## Project Overview

This game replicates the classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience where two players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. The game ends in a draw if the grid is filled without any player achieving alignment.

### Features
- []**Interactive UI**: Playable grid with responsive button clicks.
- []**Win Detection**: Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
- []**Draw Handling**: Ends the game if the grid is filled without a winner.
- []**Bug-Free Gameplay**: Thoroughly tested to ensure zero bugs or console errors.
- []**WebGL Build**: Hosted online for easy access and playability.

2. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns clicking on available grid spaces.
3. The game declares a winner once a player aligns three of their marks.
